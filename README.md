# DBA3713-Project

This project was submitted as the final project for the National University of Singapore's module DBA3713 Analytics for Risk Management.

In this project, we constructed some portfolios using classical investment strategies such as equal-weighted, global minimum variance, and tangency portfolios and assess their performances (expected returns, standard deviations, and Sharpe ratio). Using these portfolios as our baseline, we then explored the effects of the following factors to the performances of the portfolios:
- time window considered for data analysis
- suitable shrinkage estimators for covariance matrix, beta, and expected return estimations as well as the weight assigned to these shrinkage estimators
- no-shorting constraints
